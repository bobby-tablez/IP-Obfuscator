# IP-Obfuscator
This PowerShell script takes a standard IPv4 address and obfuscates it using several methods. Each method "should" be interpreted correctly using a console, browser, or compiler.

The script supports several conversion methods such as decimal, several hexadecimal conversions, mixed notation such as hex+decimal, and several octal conversion methods. 

## Example (Hex+Octal)
`0x8e.16433102` becomes `142.250.191.206` (Google)
